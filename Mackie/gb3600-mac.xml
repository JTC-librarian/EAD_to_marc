      <p>
        British screenwriter and producer Philip Mackie was born in Salford, Lancashire on 26 November 1918. He studied English at University College London, graduating in 1939. After serving in the army in World War Two, he worked for the Ministry of Information, producing documentary films. From 1954 he began a career as a writer, publishing a novel,
        <title>Hurrah, the Flag!</title>
        (1957), in addition to scripting several works for theatre and the BBC. He served as Granada Television's Head of Drama from 1958-1962, and then worked primarily as a freelancer for the rest of his career. Many of his productions are adaptations of classic works (Maupassant [ITV, 1963], Raffles [Yorkshire TV, 1977]) or based on the lives of historical figures (The Caesars [ITV, 1968], Napoleon and Love [ITV, 1974]). His best-known work is probably The Naked Civil Servant (ITV, 1975), an adaptation of Quentin Crisp's autobiography. Mackie died on 23 December 1985.

It appears to have been under consideration for production, possibly at the BBC, as there is a memo from Mackie to D.S.S. [Director of Series and Serials?] accompanying the drafts.

              (alternative title:

              <title>Red Letter Day</title>
              (1976). It appears, however, that this episode was never made.

              <title>Wrong Number</title>
              . One script is a rehearsal script, which gives the date of transmission as Tuesday, 28 September. The other appears to be an earlier draft, is titled
              <title>Wrong Number</title>
              , and there is a note saying it should be returned to Mr Brandon Acton-Bond at the BBC. Acton-Bond is listed as the producer on the other script. There is no external evidence for the script's production, but it does appear to have gone ahead.

              <title>The Inheritance</title>
              of the 1963 Granada TV series
              <title>Maupassant</title>

              Papers relating to
              <title>The Whole Truth</title>
              , a drama by Philip Mackie. It was originally produced as a teleplay for BBC TV (1955), and reworked for stage by 1956, with an edition published. The play was later made into a film directed by John Guillermin (1958), and it appears that another version, called
              <title>Death of a Guest</title>
              , was broadcast by the BBC in 1960.

              A script for
              <title>Thou Shalt Not Kill</title>
              , a discussion programme about euthanasia which was made by Granada TV and broadcast on 25 June 1957. The script includes verbatim or suggested comments for the host, Robin Day, and contributors, and also some mini-plays illustrating the issues. Mackie's role is unclear, possibly he contributed to the script, or perhaps was a producer.

              Papers relating to
              <title>In the Fog</title>
              , a draft screenplay by Mackie of
              <title>In the Fog</title>
              , adapted from the story of the same name by Richard Harding Davis.
              <title>Victorian Villainies</title>
              (note that the title page has a misprint: "Victorian Villanies") seems to be a series title, and it may well have been intended to be an anthology series of Victorian crime stories. It appears that neither series nor episode were ever produced. The series was probably inspired by the publication of
              <title>The Penguin Book of Victorian Villainies</title>
              in 1984, which included
              <title>In the Fog</title>
